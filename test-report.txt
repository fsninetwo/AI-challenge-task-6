Total Tests: 39 passed, 0 failed

COVERAGE METRICS
===============
- Statement Coverage: 77.77%
- Branch Coverage:    72.22%
- Function Coverage:  68.42%
- Line Coverage:      75.86%

DETAILED BREAKDOWN
=================

File: enigma.js
- Lines Covered: 75.86%
- Uncovered Lines: 107-131, 139
- Uncovered Code: Interactive CLI prompt function (promptEnigma) and module main check

TEST CATEGORIES COVERED
======================

1. UTILITY FUNCTIONS (6 tests)
   ✓ mod function - handles positive, negative numbers and zero
   ✓ plugboardSwap function - character swapping and edge cases

2. ROTOR CLASS (10 tests)
   ✓ Constructor - initialization with default and custom values
   ✓ Step method - position increment and wraparound
   ✓ atNotch method - notch position detection
   ✓ Forward method - character encoding through rotor
   ✓ Backward method - character decoding and inverse operations

3. ENIGMA CLASS (21 tests)
   ✓ Constructor - rotor configuration and plugboard setup
   ✓ stepRotors method - stepping logic and double-stepping behavior
   ✓ encryptChar method - character encryption and non-alphabetic handling
   ✓ process method - string processing and case conversion
   ✓ Known test vectors - historical accuracy verification
   ✓ Edge cases - overflow handling and complex configurations
   ✓ Reflector logic - ensures no character encrypts to itself

4. INTEGRATION TESTS (2 tests)
   ✓ Long message encryption/decryption
   ✓ Complex rotor stepping scenarios

CRITICAL FEATURES TESTED
========================
✓ Double-stepping behavior (FIXED BUG)
✓ Rotor position wraparound
✓ Plugboard character swapping
✓ Ring setting effects
✓ Reflector reciprocal property
✓ State maintenance across operations
✓ Input validation and error handling
✓ Historical Enigma accuracy

UNCOVERED CODE ANALYSIS
=======================
The uncovered code (lines 107-131, 139) consists of:
- Interactive CLI prompt function (promptEnigma)
- readline interface setup and user input handling
- Module main execution check

These are intentionally not covered as they involve:
- User interaction (readline prompts)
- Process I/O operations
- CLI-specific functionality separate from core logic

COVERAGE ASSESSMENT
==================
The coverage is EXCELLENT for the core cryptographic functionality:
- All encryption/decryption logic is thoroughly tested
- Critical bug fixes are validated
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- Integration scenarios are tested

The uncovered code represents only CLI interface functions,
not the core Enigma machine implementation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
==============
1. Coverage is sufficient for production deployment
2. Core crypto logic has comprehensive test coverage
3. CLI functionality could be tested with mock stdin/stdout if needed
4. Consider adding performance benchmarks for large messages

CONCLUSION
==========
The test suite provides robust coverage of all critical Enigma machine
functionality with 39 comprehensive test cases covering utility functions,
rotor operations, encryption logic, and integration scenarios.

The fixed double-stepping bug is thoroughly validated, and the implementation
maintains historical accuracy while providing modern error handling.

Coverage Quality: EXCELLENT for core functionality
Test Reliability: HIGH (39/39 tests passing)
Bug Detection: COMPREHENSIVE (critical stepping bug caught and fixed)
